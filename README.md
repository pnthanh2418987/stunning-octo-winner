Hello!

This program use the matplotlib import

With the knowledges that CiP provide about basic python I was able to futher expand my coding skills and in this particular project, I was able to learn a bit of using matplotlib to visually demonstrate data by using graphs.

This program definitely have a lot of flaws and imperfections but it's a solid foundation so I'm very looking forward to develop it in the future as one of my personal project.

Thank you to the people of CiP for such an amazing exprience. This is a small but crucial step for my understanding of the coding world.
